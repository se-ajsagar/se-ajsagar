### Hi, I'm Ajay Sagar Parwani! üëã

I am a dedicated software engineer with nearly 10 years of experience, specializing in mobile development. I started my career as an Android developer in 2014, but after a year, I transitioned to iOS, where I have since focused extensively on building and optimizing high-quality applications. While iOS has been my primary area of expertise, I also have strong professional experience working with Android, managing products in previous roles.

Throughout my career, I‚Äôve developed iOS applications across a wide range of industries, including entertainment, healthcare, education, cybersecurity, finance, and e-commerce. In addition to mobile development, I bring expertise in QA automation using native iOS frameworks like XCTest and Selenium for web applications.

I hold a bachelor‚Äôs degree in Computer Science, with a deep passion for research, coding, and code optimization. Data structures and algorithms have always been a key area of interest for me, and during my studies, I conducted research and comparative studies in algorithms, continually striving for code efficiency.

Whether developing feature-rich mobile applications or driving innovation in software, I am always eager to expand my knowledge and contribute to impactful projects.

These days, I am actively exploring the fields of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, working on side projects to further enhance my understanding and skill set in these exciting domains.
